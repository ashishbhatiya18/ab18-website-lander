## Platform Engineering
> ### Aerospike Failover <Badge type="tip" text="Resiliency" />
> Create a resiliency layer as a platform deliverable for [99.99% uptime applications](https://sre.google/sre-book/availability-table/) leveraging [Aerospike](https://aerospike.com/) database to failover when cluster health is low and cannot provide SC mode operations.
> ### Open Telemetry Integration <Badge type="danger" text="Observability" />
> Provide Spring Boot based Applications, mechanism to send custom telemetry, with lucid pluggable Annotations based library leveraging AOP to increase the observability for the service operations.
> ### Temporal <Badge type="tip" text="Resiliency" />
